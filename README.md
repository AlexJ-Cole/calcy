CALCY-LATOR

Created a basic calculator using html/css/javascript(mostly js)

Learned:
 - Lots of practice with array/string manipulation in order to figure out order of operations
 - How to make a website compatible with mouse and keyboard controls
 - Got way better at using CSS Grid
 - How backend can be so much more chaotic than frontend
